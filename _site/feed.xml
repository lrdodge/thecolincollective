Begging to be explored, we didn’t even begin to scratch the surface during our time there.
Some of our favorite memories include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Late night AirBnB slumber parties.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Almost getting attacked by an emu at the zoo.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Crema’s amazing sweet potato pancakes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pre-show practice set with a literal third wheel character.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sharing the experience with our loved ones who were able to come along.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Improvise Like a Married Couple&lt;/em&gt; workshop was unique and fun (we yelled at our own characters).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Performing in the middle of an actual brewery!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kelly caught this moment before the show. We were all together and having silly fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the opportunity of opening for the wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http://taraandrance.com/&quot;&gt;Here, the Musical&lt;/a&gt; and share the same stage with Carla and Craig Cackowski of Orange Tuxedo.
It was such a great time we are already looking forward to next year’s festival.
If you were not able to see us in Denver, don’t be sad!
You still have a chance to see our performance.
Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

With thirty-five troupes performing over six days we more than had our fill of wonderful and talented improv.
And that’s not even counting the workshops and after-parties (karaoke!) we managed to cram into the time between shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the impossible challenge of using only a single sentence to condense our complicate feelings, we’d like to share a few of our reactions as we look back on the festival weeks.
We had such a fun time performing this year and cannot wait to return for next year’s festival.
If you missed our show you can check it out below.
Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Inspirational, educational, exhilarating, exhausting, awkward and complicated.”
- Casey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“So much wonderful improv was crammed into my brain and so much time was spent with my favorite people I’m now going into post-festival depression.” #noregrets
- Luke&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Enthusiastic and exhausting entertainment.”
- Mish&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Wonderful, exhausting fun, watching all of the people I love doing improv and some new friends too.”
- Kelly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Inspiring and exhausting and loving and fear and happy and hangover (((I took liberties with ‘use one sentence’ (I apologize (this is part of my sentence still))).”
- Jessica&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If I could have an improv festival’s baby, it’d be this one, and I’m naming it Colin.”
- Alice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Puff.
Like, a good puff.
A tired, exhausted, inspired, loved puff.”
